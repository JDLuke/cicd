As a developer, I'm basically an ant. I'm driven to create _something_.

One day I was rolling pellets around aimlessly, when I decided to check out Micronaut, which is an alternative to Spring Boot. I was hosting it on github and decided I wanted to use Actions to build my project.

I had recently come off a project which made use of a very robust build and QA system, and while I don't expect to match it feature-for-feature, I was certainly inspired by some of the ideas I saw there.

So I built a pipeline in the project. The pipeline itself became my main focus, because frankly, working on it was a lot of fun.

So now, I'm dedicating a repo to this purpose. We'll see how far I take it.

At the very least, I'll accommodate multiple java releases and build systems.
